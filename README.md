#Xamarin 4.x Cross-Platform Application Development - Third Edition
This is the code repository for [Xamarin 4.x Cross-Platform Application Development - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/xamarin-4x-cross-platform-application-development-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786465412), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Xamarin is a leading cross-platform application development tool used by top companies such as Coca-Cola, Honeywell, and Alaska Airlines to build apps. Version 4 features significant updates to the platform including the release of Xamarin.Forms 2.0 and improvements have been made to the iOS and Android designers. Xamarin was acquired by Microsoft so it is now a part of the Visual Studio family.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
class ChuckNorris
{
  void DropKick()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Dropkick!");
  }
}
```

For this book you will need a Mac computer running at least OS X 10.10. Apple requires iOS applications to be compiled on a Mac, so Xamarin has the same requirement. You can either use Xamarin Studio (best for Mac) or Visual Studio (best for Windows) as an IDE.
Developers on Windows can work on iOS applications in Visual Studio by connecting to a Mac on their local network. 
Visit https://xamarin.com/download or https://visualstudio.com/download to download the appropriate software.
Chapter 1, 7 and 12 do not require separate code files.
